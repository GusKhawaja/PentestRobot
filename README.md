# PentestRobot
This Python application will automate the following penetration testing scenarios:
1- Scan for live hosts.
2- Port scan the live hosts and identify the two remoting protocols SSH & RDP.
3- Execute a dictionary attack (only for RDP and SSH) on each live host.
4- Save the results to a file
